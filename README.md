# osb-addon-extension-manager

## Install

```
npm run osb addon add https://github.com/Michael-Gibbons/osb-addon-extension-manager
```

## Objective
This extension provides the base functionality to watch and build extensions. Currently only theme extensions are supported.

Since this is the "core" addon for extensions, it by itself does not do anything other than inject cli commands to be run on dev and build.

See [osb-addon-theme-extension-base](https://github.com/Michael-Gibbons/osb-addon-theme-extension-base) for a theme extension implementation.
